<p>I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Engineering. I had three years experience with the Java language and C Language. I've worked with development boards for two years and that is where I started getting experience with assembly language. The most exciting thing that I've done with hardware was programming touch user interface for a Senior design project and integrating the touch screen with the main controller as well as integrating the code that controls the motors and servos that run the machine with the main controller and the touch controller. As of now while I'm looking for a job I'm just teaching myself various things like scripting languages like python, javascript, SQL, etc. and review the languages I know to keep myself fresh and busy. Along with that, I'm currently prototyping a game engine as a hobby and for future use. My hope is to get an entry level job that involves software development in order to build or create something that people can use. Check</p>
